On this page, I'll explain how to download, install, and setup the *Souffleur* server. 

*Souffleur* consists of two parts:

1. The **mobile app**: you'll be using it to flip through slides. When you press its *next page* button, the app sends a command to the **Souffleur server**
2. The **Souffleur server**: it runs on your laptop. It receives commands from the **mobile app** and instructs the operating system of your laptop to send key strokes to the topmost window. If this is your presentation software, this will flip the slides.
